As a certified teacher, I lived in Shanghai between 2010 and 2019, working at international and local schools, preparing Chinese students for various exams, including GcSE Spanish. Many students are just starting to learn Spanish, so no worries if you’re a total beginner! For over 20 years, I’ve taught students at all kinds of levels, from kindergarten to university at various schools in the UK, Hungary, China and Spain. I’ve always had a passion for teaching and I love to share ideas about different cultures. The exercises focus on pronunciation, vocabulary and grammar, while the class discussions encourage oral fluency and creative thinking. The classes are fun and you’ll get some home assignments that you must complete each time. Hope to see you soon in class! Hasta pronto! (See you soon !)",
